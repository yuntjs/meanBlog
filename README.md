# Blog
In an effort to learn the MEAN Stack in a deeper manner, I am building this web application with this language. A blog consists of all the CRUD capabilities and has potential to be built upon many different programming techniques, which is why I started this project.
I hope to deploy and use this blog in the near future to write a log about my programming journey.
